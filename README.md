# CNN-Image-Classifier
This is a CNN Image Classifier built to classify Digimon and Pokemon images. Inside the repository you will find a folder containing all the test data for the Classifier to learn in order to then determine whether the image is a pokemon or a digimon

PARTS TO RUNNING:

This program is all contained within the poke_digi_classifier.py, In order for it to run properly, please have the most current version of python installed Also, before running the program, our data folder should lay in the same directory as the .py file. Within the data folder, there are two more folders. If the data folder does not meet these requirements of being in the same directory, then the program will not be able to run due to being unable to access the data.
